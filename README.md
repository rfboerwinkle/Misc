# backup.py
Python

This is a semi-automated (it will prompt you before doing anything) script to synchronizes one directory with another. By default, it will remove characters FAT doesn't like.

I wrote it to back up files to an external drive.

# calculus-solids.scad
OpenSCAD

The code has to be edited directly, but this script makes 3D models of common calculus solids (like solids of revolution or slicing).

I wrote it for my AP Calculus AB course.
